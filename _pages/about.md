I'm a PhD Candidate at Columbia University, where I work with [Suman Jana](https://www.cusec.info). We aspire cutting edge security research on the intersection of program analysis and machine learning.
Our research is all about large scale automated security analysis, program synthesis and verification of neural networks, so in my free time I like to go manual and play CTF.
